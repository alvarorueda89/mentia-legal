        <p>Mentia ("we", "our", or "the app") is an AI-powered study companion for iOS. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights.</p>

        <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>

            <li>To manage your subscription status</li>
            <li>To improve the app and fix issues</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We use the following third-party services to operate the app:</p>
